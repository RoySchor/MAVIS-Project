# MAVIS-Project
#### A MAVIS AI group project for Artificial Intelligence Class at DIS Copenhagen - study abroad.

A virtual board game of an agent and goal. Agents goal is to reach the assigned location with its corresponding number.
- We used this board game to analyze how different algorithms are better suited to solve different problems. Given this we can see how best to train an AI to solve a given task.

## What the Code Does:
This is one of many levels, using a BFS search algorithm
